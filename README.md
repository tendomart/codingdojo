#  Brief description of the data

Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI) Application - Alcohol-Attributable Fractions

ARDI is an online application that provides national and state estimates of alcohol-related health impacts, including deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL). These estimates are calculated for 58 acute and chronic causes using alcohol-attributable fractions, and are reported by age and sex for 2015-2019. This dataset provides estimates of the proportion of deaths from various causes that are attributable to alcohol.
